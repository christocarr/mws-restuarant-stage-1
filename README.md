#### _Stage 4 Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview

This project involved improving a static site by implementing responsiveness for all screen sizes, allow for screen reader use and ARIA accessablity, and an offline first approach.

### Installation

Download or clone the files to your local machine. From there start a http server with Python. 

In your terminal check the version of Python install on your machine by typing `python -V`.
If you have Python 2.x installed then run the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` otherwise, use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed then go to:[website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

When the server is running, in the browser of your choice, go to `http://localhost:8000`.

### What do I do from here?

To check offline availability go to the dev tools, network tab and check the `offline` checkbox then refresh the page.
